Your Form, your Customers. Learn how to link response identity with your existing user records.

## Method 1. Provide customer uuid via invisible form field

Add a hidden input field to your form with the name `__gf_customer_uuid` and the value of the customer's unique identifier.

```html
<form>
  <input type="hidden" name="__gf_customer_uuid" value="123456" />
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
  <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="Phone" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
