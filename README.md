- Grid
- List
- Slots (Not swapping components)
- States
- Git
- Variables
- Data layer
- Logic layer
- Design to code
- Built in base design system (Reflect - a universal design system built for design systems)

## Key features / modes

- presentation mode
- muggle mode
- developer mode
- graphics mode
- designer mode
- product mode
- prototype mode
- documentation mode
- diagram mode (EDR)
- live collaborative editing
- version control in-the-box
- responsive mode (responsive components)
- visual engine in-the-box
- context engine in-the-box
