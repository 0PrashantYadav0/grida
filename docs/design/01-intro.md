# Learn the Structural Design

## Project type

By default, we assume that you'll be one file per project. If you are using multiple files for advanced needs, pleaes read [the multi-file section](#bonus-multi-file)

## Structure your file

If you don't have a preference to directory structure, you can follow below.
All across the Grida platform, we recomment using small-kebab-case for naming and follow the web standards such as routes. (even for native platforms)

```
- readme
- /home
- /your-other-route
- (examples)
- (components)
- (tokens)
- (resources)
```

## Bonus: Multi file
